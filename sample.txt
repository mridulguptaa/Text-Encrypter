WHO HAS GOT A BETTER LIFE, A DOCTOR OR AN ENGINEER?

During the +2 level, students are often seen to be confused regarding which field to choose, medical or engineering. This is not an easy decision and needs to be made after much thought to the parameters of practical life; well, that is until and unless you intend to serve humanity by treating people free of cost.

Engineering and Medicine have long been the two most sought after professions in middle class India. However, slowly engineering seems to be gaining ground because the career of an engineer seems to have become more definite. Four years of engineering from a decent college of Engineering in Himachal Pradesh can fetch you a handsome salary. On the other hand, five years of basic medical study from a reputed institution gets you nowhere until and unless you do a PG specialization, which is another three years. Even this is not enough; it would be even better if you go for a ‘super specialization’, which takes another two years.
